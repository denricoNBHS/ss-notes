# Energy

**energy**- the ability to do physical work.

### Potential Energy{#potential}
**Potential Energy**-the energy exists whenever an object which has mass has a position within a force field. They are two main types of potential energy: gravitational potential energy and elastic potential energy. Chemical energy from a battery is a potential form of energy. Another example of potential energy are the bullets before they are fired from a gun, a car that is parked on the top of the hill, and a ferris wheel before it starts to turn.

### Kinetic Energy{#kinetic}
**kinetic energy**- energy possessed by virtue of being in motion.

  Kinetic energy starts from potential energy which is energy that is stored. Once the energy is in motion is turns into kinetic energy. For example, a rock at the edge of a cliff, that rock has stored energy (potential energy), if that rock were to fall of the cliff, while it is falling the rock would then have kinetic energy because the rock is in motion. Once the rock hits the ground it no longer has kinetic energy. 

###First Law of Energy{#conservation}
**First law of energy** - energy cannot be created nor destroyed,
energy can be transformed from one form to another, the total energy of an isolated system is constant.
[First law of energy example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkUhKrFPMZ4)

Examples of Energy being transformed into another form of energy
light bulb - electrical energy turns into light energy
Stove - chemical energy turns into heat energy
Plants - light energy from the sun turns into chemical energy 

### Second Law of Energy{#entropy}
**Second Law of Thermodynamics** - Branch of physical science that deals with the relations between heat and other forms of energy, such as mechanical, electrical, or chemical energy, and by extension
